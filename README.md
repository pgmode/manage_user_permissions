# Manage User Permissions for PostgreSQL

## Overview

The `manage_user_permissions` function is a PostgreSQL extension designed to simplify and automate the management of user permissions within a PostgreSQL database. This function allows database administrators to grant or revoke various types of permissions dynamically based on predefined roles.

## Features

- **Dynamic Permission Management**: Easily grant or revoke permissions based on user roles.
- **Support for Multiple Schemas**: Operates across different schemas within the database.
- **Flexible Permission Sets**: Includes support for data loaders, data readers, data writers, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the `manage_user_permissions` function, make sure you have:

- PostgreSQL 10 or later.
- Access to a superuser role in the PostgreSQL instance.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/manage_user_permissions.git
   cd manage_user_permissions
   ```

2. **Execute the SQL Script**:
   Navigate to the directory containing `manage_user_permissions--1.0.sql` and run it using:
   ```bash
   psql -U your_superuser -d your_database -f manage_user_permissions--1.0.sql
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**:
   Connect to your database and check if the function exists:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'manage_user_permissions';
   ```

## Usage

### Granting Permissions

To grant permissions to a user:

```sql
SELECT manage_user_permissions(
    'username',           -- User name
    'database_name',      -- Database name
    'data_loader',        -- Permissions type
    'grant',              -- Action
    'public'              -- Schema (optional, default is 'public')
);
```

### Revoking Permissions

To revoke permissions from a user:

```sql
SELECT manage_user_permissions(
    'username',           -- User name
    'database_name',      -- Database name
    'data_loader',        -- Permissions type
    'revoke',             -- Action
    'public'              -- Schema (optional, default is 'public')
);
```
